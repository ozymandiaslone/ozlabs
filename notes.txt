- Liar's dice
  -> Bots playing Liar's dice

- Cellular automata where ML agents learn 
  to 'crack' neighboring cells' 'codes' &
  genereate their own new ownership 'code'

  -> Each agent cell has an encoder/decoder
     which we may want to allow to mutate

  -> Start the field out by creating a tor
     -oidal grid and populating it randomly
     (or perhaps according to some distribu
     -tion | or perhaps even order them seq
     -uentially) with 512-bit binary values.

  -> Each 'owned' cell attempts to first gu
     -ess its neighboring cells' values.
